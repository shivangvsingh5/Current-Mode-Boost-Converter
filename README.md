# Current-Mode-Boost-Converter

Obtaining changes in the output voltage of Boost converter under variable load conditions is a major challenge in industrial applications nowadays. This paper will provide an insight of using peak current mode control for a Boost Converter.

In todayâ€™s fast moving digital world, power supplies play a key role in the functionality of devices. Inside the world of power supplies, we have a boost converter, which is a step up DC-DC power converter, which increases the voltage coming from the input source to its load at the output portion. It is commonly used in several applications including hybrid vehicles, power systems for achieving higher output voltages, inverter systems used in wind energy turbines, mobile applications, and many more. A boost converter belongs to the class of Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS), which makes usage of at least two semiconductors and at least a power saving element, such as a capacitor.
